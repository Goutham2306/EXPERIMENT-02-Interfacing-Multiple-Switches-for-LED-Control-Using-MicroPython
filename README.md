FIGURE-01: RASPBERRY PI PICO PINOUT DIAGRAM

Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller board based on the RP2040 chip. It supports MicroPython, making it suitable for IoT and embedded applications. The Raspberry Pi Pico is a compact microcontroller board featuring a 40-pin layout, including power, ground, GPIO, and communication interface pins. It operates with a dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor and supports MicroPython and C/C++ programming.

The power pins include VBUS (5V from USB), VSYS (1.8V to 5.5V input), 3V3(OUT) (regulated 3.3V output), and multiple ground (GND) connections. The board offers 26 multi-purpose GPIO pins (GP0 to GP28), which can be used for digital input, output, PWM, and communication interfaces such as I2C, SPI, and UART. It also features three analog-to-digital converter (ADC) pins (GP26, GP27, GP28), used for reading analog sensor values, along with an ADC_VREF pin to set the reference voltage.

For communication, I2C (SDA, SCL), SPI (MOSI, MISO, SCK), and UART (TX, RX) interfaces are mapped across different GPIO pins, allowing seamless connectivity with sensors and peripherals. All GPIO pins support PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), making it useful for motor control, LED brightness adjustment, and sound applications. The BOOTSEL button enables USB mass storage mode for firmware flashing, while the DEBUG pins (SWD interface) provide debugging capabilities. With its low power consumption, flexible GPIO options, and rich interface support, the Raspberry Pi Pico is widely used for IoT, embedded systems, robotics, and automation projects.

WORKING PRINCIPLE

The switches are connected as inputs to GPIO pins of the Pico.

The LEDs are connected as outputs.

A MicroPython script reads the switch states and controls the LEDs accordingly.

from machine import Pin

from time import sleep



# Define switches as input pins

switch1 = Pin(2, Pin.IN)

switch2 = Pin(3, Pin.IN)



# Define LEDs as output pins

led = Pin(15, Pin.OUT)

led2 = Pin(16, Pin.OUT)



while True:

    sw2_state = switch2.value()



    # Print switch states

    print("Switch 1 State:", sw1_state)

        led2.value(1)

    elif sw1_state == 1:
